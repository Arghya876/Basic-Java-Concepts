# Basic Java Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs demonstrating fundamental concepts and syntax in Java. These programs are designed for beginners and cover various topics such as input/output operations, control structures, loops, logical operators, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

## List of Programs

1. [HelloWorld.java](HelloWorld.java) - A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. [Variable.java](Variable.java) - Demonstrates the declaration and initialization of variables.
3. [UserInput.java](UserInput.java) - Shows how to take user input using the Scanner class.
4. [TypeCasting.java](TypeCasting.java) - Illustrates different types of type casting (implicit and explicit) in Java.
5. [ArithmeticOperator.java](ArithmeticOperator.java) - Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and displays the results.
6. [RelationalOperator.java](RelationalOperator.java) - Demonstrates the use of relational operators (>, <, ==, !=) to compare values.
7. [LogicalOperator.java](LogicalOperator.java) - Shows examples of using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) in various expressions.
8. [IncrDecrOperator.java](IncrDecrOperator.java) - Illustrates the use of increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
9. [AssignmentOperator.java](AssignmentOperator.java) - Demonstrates the use of assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=).
10. [TernaryOperator.java](TernaryOperator.java) - Shows how to use the ternary operator for conditional expressions.
11. [BitwiseOperator.java](BitwiseOperator.java) - Illustrates the use of bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~) in Java.
12. [IfElseStatement.java](IfElseStatement.java) - Demonstrates the use of if-else statements to control the flow of the program based on conditions.
13. [ElseIfLadder.java](#ElseIfLadderjava) - Demonstrates the use of an else-if ladder to determine grades based on marks.
14. [PersonCategory.java](#PersonCategoryjava) - Categorizes a person based on age and gender using nested if-else statements.
